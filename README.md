# Aether
A book tracker. You can keep track of the books that you are reading and it will show 
a graph on how many pages you have read per day, or you can do a quick calculation to know how many pages you need to read per day to finish a deadline. You can also (Optionally) set how much time you read 1 page and it will tell you how much time to read your daily pages. 

# This is my first java application
It's really bad code. I just wanted to get a taste of Java.
